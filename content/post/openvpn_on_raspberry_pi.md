For server configuration I followed the tutorial on <http://readwrite.com/2014/04/10/raspberry-pi-vpn-tutorial-server-secure-web-browsing>.

For client configuration I followed <http://readwrite.com/2014/04/11/building-a-raspberry-pi-vpn-part-two-creating-an-encrypted-client-side>.

The big problem was that I was not at home when I started this work, so to be able to open the openvpn port in the firewall I had to tunnel the VPN traffic over SSH. For this I followed this tutorial <https://redfern.me/tunneling-openvpn-through-ssh/>.
